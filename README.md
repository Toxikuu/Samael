Samael
Intro
    Samael is a terminal-based free and open source duels antisniper. This means you can change whatever you want about the code, make forks, and share it freely.
    It is meant to be used alongside Lilith.
    You're allowed to repurpose any code in Samael into your own projects.
    If someone sold you Samael, you got played lmao.
    If you decide to make a fork of Samael, kindly refrain from adding malware. Also, consider making your forks FOSS aswell!
    Samael is licensed under the MIT License.

Prerequisites
    To use Samael, you need to have Python installed. It's also recommended that you add Python to path, and that you use an IDE (examples: VSCode, Neovim, IntelliJ, etc.) to modify the code.
    I also highly recommend Windows Terminal to launch it as it makes your life much easier (and fixes weird color and formatting issues).

Setup
    Just run the exe after adding your API key to apikey.txt.

Blacklist and ApiKey
    Edit blacklist.txt to have a list of UUIDs you want to blacklist. It also works with names, however names are subject to change, so UUIDs are recommended.
    Same with safelist.txt and weirdlist.txt
    Edit apikey.txt by copy pasting your API key into it.
 
Launching
    Once you've changed apikeydir and blacklist to the correct file locations, you can either run Samael.py with the command:
        python <your Samael.py directory>
    Or you can just run the exe, or create a launch.bat with the python run command.

    If you have any issue with the setup, ask in ⁠help.
    If you want coding help when adding new features or customizing Samael, ask in ⁠coding-help.
    The latest version of Samael will be available in ⁠downloads. You do not need to be running the latest version of Samael, since it's all stored locally. Later versions will just have more features.
